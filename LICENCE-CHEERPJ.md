## Does the standard CheerpJ Non Commercial Licence allow me to do non-commercial purposes such as non-commercial applications or internal technology evaluation?

Yes, you can perform technical evaluations using the CheerpJ AOT compiler and linking the
CheerpJ Runtime hosted on the Leaning Technologies Limited cloud.

However, according to [this licence](https://leaningtech.com/cheerpj-non-commercial-licence/), you CANNOT have commercial use of your product
using the CheerpJ AOT compiler.
